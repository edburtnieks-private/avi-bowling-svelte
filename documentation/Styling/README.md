# Project documentation, Structure, Guidelines

## Styling

All component related styles should live in `.svelte` component file

CSS rules should be sorted in alphabetical order unless styling doesn't work as intended and css rule order matters

## Global Styles

### Structure

Global styles live in [public/global.css](../../public/global.css) file and it contains styles that apply for overall page (e.g. `html`, `body` tags) and all css variables

### Variables

#### Naming

Variables should be prefixed with some css rule shortened name (e.g. `--bs-navigation` for `box-shadow` rule)
